# Composite types

# Types redux
We have previously looked at some of the basic types in the Rust typesystem

- Primitives (integers, floats, booleans, characters)
- Compounds (tuples, arrays)
- Most of the types we looked at were `Copy`
- Borrowing will make more sense when we look at some more ways we can type
  our data

---

# Structuring data
Rust has two important ways to structure data

* structs
* enums
* ~~unions~~

<!--
- We have unions in Rust, but almost everywhere you will use enums instead.
  Unions become relevant once we start talking about FFI and unsafe Rust code.
-->

---

# Structs
A struct is similar to a tuple, but this time the combined type gets its own name

```rust
struct ControlPoint(f64, f64, bool);
```

<v-click>

This is an example of a *tuple struct*. You can access the fields in the struct
the same way as with tuples:

```rust
fn main() {
  let cp = ControlPoint(10.5, 12.3, true);
  println!("{}", cp.0); // prints 10.5
}
```

</v-click>

<!--
- Note that two tuples with the same fields in the same order are always the
  same type, whereas two structs with different names but the same fields are
  different types.
-->

---

# Structs
Much more common though are structs with named fields

```rust
struct ControlPoint {
  x: f64,
  y: f64,
  enabled: bool,
}
```

* We can add a little more purpose to each field
* No need to keep our indexing up to date when we add or remove a field

<v-click>


```rust {all|2-6|7}
fn main() {
  let cp = ControlPoint {
    x: 10.5,
    y: 12.3,
    enabled: true,
  };
  println!("{}", cp.x); // prints 10.5
}
```

</v-click>

<!--
- Named fields are especially easier in usage, as a type alone will most of
  the time not be enough information to determine the full meaning, here we now
  now that the two floats meant the x and y coordinates and we know what the
  boolean indicated.
- To instantiate (create a value) of a struct we use the syntax shown
- Now, we can use the same `x.y` syntax as with tuples, but we have a nice
  name for referencing our fields instead of having to remember the exact
  field index.
-->

# Enumerations
One of the more powerful kinds of types in Rust are enumerations

```rust{all|2|all}
enum IpAddressType {
  Ipv4,
  Ipv6,
}
```

<v-click>

* An enumeration (listing) of different *variants*
* Each variant is an alternative value of the enum, you pick a single value to
  create an instance
* Each variant has a discriminant (hidden by default)
  * a numeric value (`isize` by default, can be changed by using `#[repr(numeric_type)]`) used to determine the variant that the enumeration holds
  * one cannot rely on the fact that the discriminant is an `isize`, the compiler may always decide to optimize it

</v-click>

<v-click>

```rust
fn main() {
  let ip_type = IpAddressType::Ipv4;
}
```

</v-click>

---

# Enumerations
Enums get more powerful, because each variant can have associated data with
it

```rust
enum IpAddress {
  Ipv4(u8, u8, u8, u8),                           // = 0 (default discriminant)
  Ipv6(u16, u16, u16, u16, u16, u16, u16, u16),   // = 1 (default discriminant)
}
```

* This way, the associated data and the variant are bound together
* Impossible to create an ipv6 address while only giving a 32 bits integer

```rust
fn main() {
  let ipv4_home = IpAddress::Ipv4(127, 0, 0, 1);
  let ipv6_home = IpAddress::Ipv6(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1);
}
```

* An enum always is as large as the largest variant plus the size of the discriminant

<div style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; display:block; width:100%;">

<LightOrDark>
    <template #dark>
        <div style="padding: 20px; background-color:#1b1b1b; border-radius: var(--slidev-code-radius) !important;">

        </div>
    </template>
    <template #light>

        </div>
    </template>

# Pattern matching

---

# Extracting data from `enum`

- We must ensure we interpret `enum` data correctly
- Use pattern matching to do so

---

# Pattern matching
Using the `if let [pattern] = [value]` statement

```rust
fn accept_ipv4(ip: IpAddress) {
  if let IpAddress::Ipv4(a, b, _, _) = ip {
    println!("Accepted, first octet is {} and second is {}", a, b);
  }
}
```

* `a` and `b` introduce local variables within the body of the if that contain
  the values of those fields
* The underscore (`_`) can be used to accept any value

---

# Match

Pattern matching is very powerful if combined with `match`

```rust
fn accept_home(ip: IpAddress) {
  match ip {
    IpAddress::Ipv4(127, 0, 0, 1) => {
      println!("You are home!");
    },
    IpAddress::Ipv6(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1) => {
      println!("You are in your new home!");
    },
    _ => {
      println!("You are not home");
    },
  }
}
```

* the body of a `match` contains one or more *arm*s
* arms are evaluated from top to bottom
* the patterns must be exhaustive: every possible value must be matched by an arm
* You can use a catch-all `_` arm to catch any remaining cases

---

# Match as an expression

A `match` evaluates to a value:

```rust
fn get_first_byte(ip: IpAddress) {
  let first_byte = match ip {
    IpAddress::Ipv4(a, _, _, _) => a,
    IpAddress::Ipv6(a, _, _, _, _, _, _, _) => a / 256 as u8,
  };
  println!("The first byte was: {}", first_byte);
}
```

* The match arms can evaluate to a value, but their types have to match
* Note how here we do not need a catch all (`_ =>`) arm because all cases have
  already been handled by the two arms

---

# `impl` blocks

---

# `impl` blocks
To associate functions to `structs` and `enums`, we use `impl` blocks

```rust {3}
fn main() {
  let x = Some(42);
  let unwrapped = x.unwrap();
  println!("{}", unwrapped);
}
```

* The syntax `x.y()` looks similar to how we accessed a field in a struct
* We can define functions on our types using impl blocks
* Impl blocks can be defined on any type, not just structs (with some limitations)

---

# `impl` blocks

```rust {all|6,13|7-12|7|17}
enum IpAddress {
  Ipv4(u8, u8, u8, u8),
  Ipv6(u16, u16, u16, u16, u16, u16, u16, u16),
}

impl IpAddress {
  fn as_u32(&self) -> Option<u32> {
    match self {
      IpAddress::Ipv4(a, b, c, d) => Some(u32::from_le_bytes([a, b, c, d])),
      _ => None,
    }
  }
}

fn main() {
  let addr = IpAddress::Ipv4(127, 0, 0, 1);
  println!("{:?}", addr.as_u32());
}
```

<!--
- Here we define the as_u32 method
- Note how the impl block is separate from the type definition
- In fact we can have multiple impl blocks for the same type, as long as
  function definitions do not overlap (not useful right now, but it will be
  once we get more into generics)
-->

---

# `self` and `Self`

- The `self` parameter defines how the method can be used.
- The `Self` type is a shorthand for the type on which the current
  implementation is specified.

```rust {all|4-6|8-14|16-18}
struct Foo(i32);

impl Foo {
  fn consume(self) -> Self {            // Takes `Foo` by value, returns `Foo`
    Self(self.0 + 1)
  }

  fn borrow(&self) -> &i32 {            // Takes immutable reference of `Foo`
    &self.0
  }

  fn borrow_mut(&mut self) -> &mut i32 { // Takes mutable reference of `Foo`
    &mut self.0
  }

  fn new() -> Self {                     // Associated function, returns `Foo`
    Self(0)
  }
}
```

---

# `impl` blocks, the `self` parameter
The self parameter is called the *receiver*.

* The `self` parameter is always the first and it always has the type on which it
  was defined
* We never specify the type of the `self` parameter
* We can optionally prepend `&` or `&mut ` to `self` to indicate that we take
  a value by reference
* Absence of a `self` parameter means that the function is an associated function
  instead

```rust
fn main () {
  let mut f = Foo::new();
  println!("{}", f.borrow());
  *f.borrow_mut() = 10;
  let g = f.consume();
  println!("{}", g.borrow());
}
```

layout: section

# Optionals and Error handling
---

# Generics
Structs become even more powerful if we introduce a little of generics

```rust
struct PointFloat(f64, f64);
struct PointInt(i64, i64);
```

We are repeating ourselves here, what if we could write a data structure for
both of these cases?

<v-click>

```rust
struct Point<T>(T, T);

fn main() {
  let float_point: Point<f64> = Point(10.0, 10.0);
  let int_point: Point<i64> = Point(10, 10);
}
```

Generics are much more powerful, but this is all we need for now

</v-click>

<!--
* The upper case letter between the angled brackets introduces a generic type
  parameter.
* We can now use that generic type variable we introduced as a type name
* Then at the point of using the type we can specify which actual type we
  want to use
* Generics are much more powerful, but this is enough for now
-->


---

# Option
A quick look into the basic enums available in the standard library

* Rust does not have null, but you can still define variables that optionally
  do not have a value
* For this you can use the `Option<T>` enum

```rust
enum Option<T> {
  Some(T),
  None,
}

fn main() {
  let some_int = Option::Some(42);
  let no_string: Option<String> = Option::None;
}
```

<!--
* Note how Rust can infer the type of `some_int`, but we have to specify what
  the type of the Option is in the None case, because it cannot possibly know
  what kind of values you could put in that Option
* Also not that for normal enums we have to import the variants, but Option
  is so common that the variants are available by default without needing to
  prefix them with `Option::`
-->

---

  Some(T),
  None,
}

fn main() {
  let some_int = Some(42);
  let no_string: Option<String> = None;
}
```

---

# Error handling
What would we do when there is an error?

```rust
fn divide(x: i64, y: i64) -> i64 {
  if y == 0 {
    // what to do now?
  } else {
    x / y
  }
}
```

---

# Error handling
What would we do when there is an error?

```rust
fn divide(x: i64, y: i64) -> i64 {
  if y == 0 {
    panic!("Cannot divide by zero");
  } else {
    x / y
  }
}
```

* A panic in Rust is the most basic way to handle errors
* A panic error is an all or nothing kind of error
* A panic will immediately stop running the current thread/program and instead
  immediately work to shut it down, using one of two methods:
  * Unwinding: going up through the stack and making sure that each value
    is cleaned up
  * Aborting: ignore everything and immediately exit the thread/program
* Only use panic in small programs if normal error handling would also exit
  the program
* Avoid using panic in library code or other reusable components

<!--
* Unwinding has its usages, mainly to clean up resources that you previously
  opened.
* An unwind can be stopped, but this is highly unusual to do and very expensive
* In a multithreaded program unwinding is essential to make sure that any
  memory owned by that thread is freed, making sure you don't have any memory
  leaks
* Rust programs are compiled such that if a panic does not occur, it doesn't
  add any extra cost, but that does mean that if a panic does occur, it isn't
  very fast
* Generally panicking should be avoided as much as possible
* The panic! macro is not the only way to trigger a panic, so beware, we will
  see some ways we can also trigger a panic very soon
* Note that if the main thread panics, the entire program will always exit
-->

---

# Error handling
What would we do when there is an error? We could try and use the option enum
instead of panicking

```rust
fn divide(x: i64, y: i64) -> Option<i64> {
  if y == 0 {
    None
  } else {
    Some(x / y)
  }
}
```

https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.i64.html#method.checked_div

---

# Result

A `Result` provides a reason for the failure:

```rust
enum Result<T, E> {
  Ok(T),
  Err(E),
}

enum DivideError {
  DivisionByZero,
  Overflow
}

fn divide(x: i64, y: i64) -> Result<i64, DivideError> {
    match y { 
        0 => Err(DivideError::DivisionByZero),
        -1 if x == i64::MIN => Err(DivideError::Overflow),
        _ => Ok(x / y),
    }
}
```

---

# Handling results
Now that we have a function that returns a result we have to think about how
we handle that error at the call-site

```rust
fn div_zero_fails() {
  match divide(10, 0) {
    Ok(div) => println!("{div}"),
    Err(e) => panic!("invalid operands"),
  }
}
```

* We made the signature of the `divide` function explicit in how it can fail
* The user of the function can now decide what to do, even if it is panicking
* Note: just as with `Option` we never have to use `Result::Ok` and
  `Result::Err` because they have been made available globally


<!--
- Note how in this case the error still causes a panic, but at least we get a
  choice of what we do
-->

---

# Handling results
Especially when writing initial prototyping code you will often find yourself
wanting to write error handling code later, Rust has a useful utility function
to help you for both `Option` and `Result`:

```rust
fn div_zero_fails() {
  let div = divide(10, 0).unwrap();
  println!("{div}");
}
```

* Unwrap checks if the Result/Option is `Ok(x)` or `Some(x)` respectively and
  then return that `x`, otherwise it will panic your program with an error
  message
* Having unwraps all over the place is generally considered a bad practice
* Sometimes you can ensure that an error won't occur, in such cases `unwrap`
  can be a good solution

---

# Handling results
Especially when writing initial prototyping code you will often find yourself
wanting to write error handling code later, Rust has a useful utility function
to help you for both `Option` and `Result`:

```rust
fn div_zero_fails() {
  let div = divide(10, 0).unwrap_or(-1);
  println!("{div}");
}
```

Besides unwrap, there are some other useful utility functions

- `unwrap_or(val)`: If there is an error, use the value given to unwrap_or
  instead
- `unwrap_or_default()`: Use the default value for that type if there is an
  error
- `expect(msg)`: Same as unwrap, but instead pass a custom error message
- `unwrap_or_else(fn)`: Same as unwrap_or, but instead call a function that
  generates a value in case of an error

<!--
* unwrap_or_else is mainly useful if generating a default value is an expensive
  operation
-->

---

# Result and the `?` operator
Results are so common that there is a special operator associated with them, the
`?` operator

```rust
fn can_fail() -> Result<i64, DivideError> {
  let intermediate_result = match divide(10, 0) {
    Ok(ir) => ir,
    Err(e) => return Err(e),
  };

  match divide(intermediate_result, 0) {
    Ok(sec) => Ok(sec * 2),
    Err(e) => Err(e),
  }
}
```

<v-click>

Look how this function changes if we use the `?` operator

```rust
fn can_fail() -> Result<i64, DivideError> {
  let intermediate_result = divide(10, 0)?;
  Ok(divide(intermediate_result, 0)? * 2)
}
```

</v-click>

---

# Result and the `?` operator

```rust
fn can_fail() -> Result<i64, DivideError> {
  let intermediate_result = divide(10, 0)?;
  Ok(divide(intermediate_result, 0)? * 2)
}
```

* The `?` operator does an implicit match, if there is an error, that error
  is then immediately returned and the function returns early
* If the result is `Ok()` then the value is extracted and we can continue right
  away

# Data Structures 

---

# `Vec`: storing more of the same
The vector is an array that can grow

* Compare this to the array we previously saw, which has a fixed size

```rust
fn main() {
  let arr = [1, 2];
  println!("{:?}", arr);

  let mut nums = Vec::new();
  nums.push(1);
  nums.push(2);
  println!("{:?}", nums);
}
```

---

# `Vec`
`Vec` is such a common type that there is an easy way to initialize
it with values that looks similar to arrays

```rust
fn main() {
  let mut nums = vec![1, 2];
  nums.push(3);
  println!("{:?}", nums);
}
```

---

# `Vec`: memory layout
How can a vector grow? Things on the stack need to be of a fixed size

# Slices

# Vectors and arrays
What if we wanted to write a sum function, we could define one for arrays of
a specific size:

```rust
fn sum(data: &[i64; 10]) -> i64 {
  let mut total = 0;
  for val in data {
    total += val;
  }
  total
}
```

---

# Vectors and arrays
Or one for just vectors:

```rust
fn sum(data: &Vec<i64>) -> i64 {
  let mut total = 0;
  for val in data {
    total += val;
  }
  total
}
```

---

# Slices
What if we want something to work on arrays of any size? Or what if we want
to support summing up only parts of a vector?

* A slice is a dynamically sized view into a contiguous sequence
* Contiguous: elements are layed out in memory such that they are evenly spaced
* Dynamically sized: the size of the slice is not stored in the type, but is
  determined at runtime
* View: a slice is never an owned data structure
* Slices are typed as `[T]`, where `T` is the type of the elements in the slice

---

# Slices

fn sum(data: [i64]) -> i64 {
  let mut total = 0;
  for val in data {

# Creating slices
Because we cannot create slices out of thin air, they have to be located
somewhere. There are three possible ways to create slices:

* Using a borrow
  - We can borrow from arrays and vectors to create a slice of their entire
    contents
* Using ranges
  - We can use ranges to create a slice from parts of a vector or array
* Using a literal (for immutable slices only)
  - We can have memory statically available from our compiled binary

---

# Creating slices
Using a borrow

```rust
fn sum(data: &[i32]) -> i32 { /* ... */ }

fn main() {
  let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
  let total = sum(&v);
  println!("{}", total);
}
```

---

# Creating slices
Using ranges

```rust
fn sum(data: &[i32]) -> i32 { /* ... */ }

fn main() {
  let v = vec![0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7];
  let all = sum(&v[..]);
  let except_first = sum(&v[1..]);
  let except_last = sum(&v[..5]);
  let except_ends = sum(&v[1..5]);
  let middle = sum(&v[4..][..4]);
}
```

* The range `start..end` contains all values `x` with `start <= x < end`.

<v-click>

* Note: you can also use ranges on their own, for example in a for loop:

```rust
fn main() {
  for i in 0..10 {
    println!("{}", i);
  }
}
```

</v-click>

---

# Creating slices
From a literal

```rust {3-5,12|7-9,13|all}
fn sum(data: &[i32]) -> i32 { todo!("Sum all items in `data`") }

fn get_v_arr() -> &'static [i32] {
    &[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
}

fn main() {
  let all = sum(get_v_arr());
}
```

<v-click>

* Interestingly `get_v_arr` works, even though the literal looks like it would
  only exist temporarily
* Literals actually exist during the entire lifetime of the program
* `&'static` here is used to indicate that this slice will exist the entire
  lifetime of the program

</v-click>
---

# Strings
We have already seen the `String` type being used before, but let's dive a
little deeper

* Strings are used to represent text
* In Rust they are always valid UTF-8
* Their data is stored on the heap
* A String is almost the same as `Vec<u8>` with extra checks to prevent
  creating invalid text
<!--
- We store data on the heap, so we can easily have strings of variable sizes
  and grow and shrink them as needed when they are modified.
- In general we really don't care about the exact length of the string

# Strings
Let's take a look at some strings

```rust
fn main() {
  let s = String::from("Hello world\nSee you!");
  println!("{:?}", s.split_once(" "));
  println!("{}", s.len());
  println!("{:?}", s.starts_with("Hello"));
  println!("{}", s.to_uppercase());
  for line in s.lines() {
    println!("{}", line);
  }
}
```

# String literals
We have already seen string literals being used while constructing a string.
The string literal is what arrays are to vectors

```rust
fn main() {
  let s1 = "Hello world";
  let s2 = String::from("Hello world");
}
```

# String literals
We have already seen string literals being used while constructing a string.
The string literal is what arrays are to vectors

```rust
fn main() {
  let s1: &'static str = "Hello world";
  let s2: String = String::from("Hello world");
}
```

* `s1` is actually a slice, a string slice

# String literals
We have already seen string literals being used while constructing a string.
The string literal is what arrays are to vectors

```rust
fn main() {
  let s1: &str = "Hello world";
  let s2: String = String::from("Hello world");
}
```

* `s1` is actually a slice, a string slice

# `str` - the string slice
It should be possible to have a reference to part of a string. But what is it?

* Not `[u8]`: not every sequence of bytes is valid UTF-8
* Not `[char]`: we could not create a slice from a string since it is stored as
  UTF-8 encoded bytes
* We introduce a new special kind of slice: `str`
* For string slices we do not use brackets!

---

# `str`, `String`, `[T; N]`, `Vec`

| Static   | Dynamic  | Borrowed |
|----------|----------|----------|
| `[T; N]` | `Vec<T>` | `&[T]`   |
| -        | `String` | `&str`   |

* There is no static variant of str
* This would only be useful if we wanted strings of an exact length
* But just like we had the static slice literals, we can use `&'static str`
  literals for that instead!

---

# `String` or `str`
When do we use `String` and when do we use `str`?

```rust
fn string_len(data: &String) -> usize {
  data.len()
}
```

---

# `String` or `str`
When do we use String and when do we use str?

```rust
fn string_len(data: &str) -> usize {
  data.len()
}
```

* Prefer `&str` over `String` whenever possible
* If you need to mutate a string you might try `&mut str`, but you cannot change a slice's length
* Use `String` or `&mut String` if you need to fully mutate the string

# Smart pointers

# Put it in a `Box`
That pointer from the stack to the heap, how do we create such a thing?

* Boxing something is the way to store a value on the heap
* A `Box` uniquely owns that value, there is no one else that also owns that same
  value
* Even if the type inside the box is `Copy`, the box itself is not, move
  semantics apply to a box.

```rust
fn main() {
  // put an integer on the heap
  let boxed_int = Box::new(10);
}
```
<div style="margin-top: 50px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; display:block;">

<LightOrDark>
    <template #dark>
      <div style="padding: 20px; background-color:#1b1b1b; border-radius: var(--slidev-code-radius) !important;">
          <img src="/images/A2-box-in-memory-dark.svg"/>
      </div>
    </template>
    <template #light>
        <div style="padding: 20px; background-color:#F8F8F8; border-radius: var(--slidev-code-radius) !important;">
          <img src="/images/A2-box-in-memory-light.svg"/>
        </div>
    </template>
</LightOrDark>

</div>

# Boxing
There are several reasons to box a variable on the heap

* When something is too large to move around
* We need something that is sized dynamically
* For writing recursive data structures

```rust
struct Node {
  data: Vec<u8>,
  parent: Box<Node>,
}
```

<!--
- Allowing arbitrarily large values on the stack would quickly let our
  function calls exhaust the stack limit
- Especially if a move actually would involve memcopying the bits to another
  location in memory that would take way too long
- Of course the main reason that a vector uses the heap is to be able to be
  sized dynamically, but even so, a vector can be large, whereas an array will
  generally always have a limited size
-->

# `HashMap` and `HashSet`

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut map = HashMap::new();
map.insert(1, "a");
assert_eq!(map.contains_key(&1), true);
assert_eq!(map.contains_key(&2), false);
```

And other collections:

- Sequences: `Vec`, `VecDeque`, `LinkedList`
- Maps: `HashMap`, `BTreeMap`
- Sets: `HashSet`, `BTreeSet`
- Misc: `BinaryHeap`
