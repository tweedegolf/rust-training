<!--
- `fn main()` is the entrypoint of your program
- `println!` (output something to stdout)
- Note the call syntax `fib(6)` with comma separated parameters
- exclamation mark is a macro (we'll see later)
- `fn` short for function, declare a function
- we see our first types here, we'll see more about them later
- `u64` unsigned integer types, all integers have an explicit size, 64 bits in
this case
- `if-else` is without parenthesis for the expression, but with required braces
for the blocks
- no explicit return keyword (will get back to that)

<!--
- By convention Rust uses snake case (i.e. all lowercase with underscores) for
variable names
- The immutable variable cannot be mutated in any way (exceptions apply)
-->

# Variables

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut some_x = 5;
    println!("some_x = {}", some_x);
    some_x = 6;
    println!("some_x = {}", some_x);

some_x = 6
```

</div>

</v-click>

<!--
- We declare a mutable variable by adding `mut`, we can update the value for
that variable
-->

---

# Type annotations

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut some_x: i32 = 5;
    //            ^^^^^ Type annotation
    println!("some_x = {}", some_x);
    some_x = 6;
    println!("some_x = {}", some_x);
}
```

- Rust is strongly and strictly typed
- Variables use type inference, so no need to specify a type
- We can be explicit in our types (and sometimes have to be)

---

# Control flow

```rust {all|2-10|12-16|18-20|all}
fn main() {
    let mut x = 0;
    loop {
        if x < 6 {
            println!("x: {}", x);
            x += 1;
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }

    let mut y = 0;
    while y < 6 {
        println!("y: {}", y);
        y += 1;
    }

    for z in 0..6 {
        println!("z: {}", z);
    }
}
```

<!--
- A loop or if condition must always evaluate to a boolean type, so no `if 1`
- Use break to break out of a loop, also works with for and while, continue
to skip to the next iteration

# Integers

| Length        | Signed  | Unsigned |
| ------------- | ------- | -------- |
| 8 bits        | `i8`    | `u8`     |
| 16 bits       | `i16`   | `u16`    |
| 32 bits       | `i32`   | `u32`    |
| 64 bits       | `i64`   | `u64`    |
| 128 bits      | `i128`  | `u128`   |
| pointer-sized | `isize` | `usize`  |

- Rust prefers explicit integer sizes
- Use `isize` and `usize` sparingly

# Literals

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 42; // decimal as i32
    let y = 42u64; // decimal as u64
    let z = 42_000; // underscore separator

    let u = 0xff; // hexadecimal
    let v = 0o77; // octal
    let w = 0b0100_1101; // binary
    let q = b'A'; // byte syntax (stored as u8)
}
```

</v-click>

<!--
- Use isize and usize mostly when working with indexing or other things
that need to have a specific size for your platform
-->

---

# Floating points and floating point literals

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 2.0; // f64
    let y = 1.0f32; // f32
}
```

- `f32`: single precision (32-bit) floating point number
- `f64`: double precision (64-bit) floating point number

<!--
- Rust uses f64 by default
- Similar to integers you can append the type of float to indicate a specific
literal type
-->

---

# Numerical operations

```rust
fn main() {
    let sum = 5 + 10;
    let difference = 10 - 3;
    let mult = 2 * 8;
    let div = 2.4 / 3.5;
    let int_div = 10 / 3; // 3
    let remainder = 20 % 3;
}
```

<v-click>

- These expressions do overflow/underflow checking in debug
- In release builds these expressions are wrapping, for efficiency
- You cannot mix and match types here, not even between different integer
types

```rust
fn main() {
    let invalid_div = 2.4 / 5;          // Error!
    let invalid_add = 20u32 + 40u64;    // Error!
}
```

</v-click>

<!--
- Rust has your typical operations, just as with other C-like languages
-->

---

# Booleans and boolean operations

```rust
fn main() {
    let yes: bool = true;
    let no: bool = false;
    let not = !no;
    let and = yes && no;
    let or = yes || no;
    let xor = yes ^ no;
}
```

---

# Comparison operators

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 10;
    let y = 20;
    x < y; // true
    x > y; // false
    x <= y; // true
    x >= y; // false
    x == y; // false
    x != y; // true
}
```

Note: as with numerical operators, you cannot compare different integer and
float types with each other

```rust
fn main() {
    3.0 < 20; // invalid
    30u64 > 20i32; // invalid
}
```

<!--
- Boolean operators short-circuit: i.e. if in `a && b`, a is already false,
then the code for b is not executed
-->

---

# Characters

```rust
fn main() {
    let c: char = 'z';
    let z = '‚Ñ§';
    let heart_eyed_cat = 'üòª';
}
```

- A `char` is a 32-bit unicode scalar value
- Very much unlike C/C++ where `char` is 8 bits

<!--
- The final scalar type is the character, but it isn't often seen.
- Note that it is not the same as u8 (a byte) in Rust, and cannot be used
interchangeably.
- We'll see later that strings do not use chars, but are encoded as UTF-8
instead.
-->

---

# `String`s
```rust

    let s1 = String::from("Hello, üåç!");
    //       ^^^^^^ Owned, heap-allocated string
```

- Rust `String`s are UTF-8-encoded
- Unlike C/C++: *Not null-terminated*
- Cannot be indexed like C strings
- `String` is heap-allocated
- Actually many types of strings in Rust
    - `CString`
    - `PathBuf`
    - `OsString`
    - ...

<!--
- Rusts strings are complicated, because all strings are complicated
- Rusts strings are UTF-8 encoded sequences. Not null terminated unlike C/C++
- Literal strings are static by default, called string *slices*, being pointers to their start, accompanied with the length
-->

# Tuples

::left::

```rust
fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f32, char) = (1, 2.0, 'a');
}
```

- Group multiple values into a single compound type
- Fixed size
- Different types per element
- Create by writing a comma-separated list of values inside parentheses

::right::

<v-click>

```rust
fn main() {
    let tup = (1, 2.0, 'Z');
    let (a, b, c) = tup;
    println!("({}, {}, {})", a, b, c);

    let another_tuple = (true, 42);
    println!("{}", another_tuple.1);
}
```

- Tuples can be destructured to get to their individual values
- You can also access individual elements using the period operator followed by
  a zero based index

</v-click>

<!--
- Note how the tuple type and the tuple value are constructed similarly, but
the type contains individual element types
- We will see more powerful variants of this destructuring later
- Note that after destructuring the original value is no longer accessible
-->

---

# Arrays

```rust
fn main() {
    let arr: [i32; 3] = [1, 2, 3];
    println!("{}", arr[0]);
    let [a, b, c] = arr;
    println!("[{}, {}, {}]", a, b, c);
}
```

- Also a collection of multiple values, but this time all of the same type
- Always a fixed length at compile time (similar to tuples)
- Use square brackets to access an individual value
- Destructuring as with tuples
- Rust always checks array bounds when accessing a value in an array

<!--
- Create an array by writing a comma-separated list of values inside brackets
- Note how unlike C/C++ arrays must always have a length defined at compile
time and cannot be constructed dynamically
- You can also construct an array using [value; repetitions] instead of having
to write out each value if you have a repeating value.
- For the type declaration the element type and count are separated by a semicolon and
written between brackets
-->

# Putting it together

---

# Statements
- Statements either *declare* something, or *perform an action*
- Most things Rust are expressions, not statements


## Example statements
```rust
println!("{}", 5);
```

```rust
let x = 10;
```

```rust
fn do_nothing() {}
```

<v-click>

```rust
40 + (let y = 2); // invalid!
```

</v-click>

---

# Expressions

- Expressions evaluate to a value
- Includes all control flow such as `if` and `loop`
- *Block expressions* (`{` and `}`): series of statements ending with an expression
- Semicolon (`;`) turns any expression into a statement

```rust {all|2-5}
fn main() {
    let y = {
        let x = 3;
        x + 1
    };
    println!("{}", y); // 4
}
```

---

# Functions

```rust
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

fn returns_nothing() {
    println!("Nothing to report");
}

fn fib(n: u64) -> u64 {
    if n <= 1 {
        return n;
    }

    fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
}
```

- Function body is a *block expression*: series of statements followed by an expression!
- `return` statement only necessary for early exits
- `fn` declaration must always be explicitly annotated with types

<!--
- Rust always uses snake case for variables and functions
- We must annotate each function parameter with a type, using a colon
- We must annotate the function return type using an arrow (`->`) followed by
the return type
- Unit may be omitted, note the syntax looks like an empty tuple: a tuple with
no value members has no instances, just as with unit.
- In Rust you must always specify your type signatures for function boundaries
-->

---

# Expressions can be everywhere

```rust {all|5,7|all}
fn main() {
    let mut y = 11;
    // if as an expression
    let x = if y % 2 != 0 {
        "odd"
    } else {
        "even"
    };
}
```

- The types of both branches of an `if` expression need to be the same
- Without `else`, that type is the *unit type* `()`

<!--
- Control flow expressions as a statement do not need to end with a semicolon
if they return *unit* (`()`)
- Remember: A block/function can end with an expression, but it needs to have
the correct type
-->

---

# Scope

- We've just seen scope braces (`{` and `}`)
- Variable scopes are important for how Rust works!

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, {}", name);  // invalid: name is not yet defined
    let name = "world";  // from this point name is in scope
    println!("Hello, {}", name);
} // name goes out of scope
```

---

# Scope

As soon as a scope ends, all variables for that scope can be removed from the
stack

```rust
fn main() { // nothing in scope here
    let i = 10; // i is now in scope
    if i > 5 {
        let j = 20; // j is now also in scope
        println!("i = {}, j = {}", i, j);
    } // j is no longer in scope, i still remains
    println!("i = {}", i);
} // i is no longer in scope
```

<!--
- Note that this is the same with C and C++
-->
