# TF–IDF

An algorithm for searching in a big collection of text documents

- term frequency–inverse document frequency
- TF: "how often does a word occur in a particular document"
- IDF: "how rare is the word across all documents"

Problem:

- how do we aggregate the results?


---
layout: default
---
# TF–IDF in Rayon

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;
use rayon::prelude::*;

fn document_frequency(documents: &[&str]) -> HashMap<&str, usize> {
    documents
        .par_iter()
        .map(|document| term_occurence(document))
        .reduce(HashMap::default, combine_occurences);
}

/// Map each word in the document to the value 1
fn term_occurence(document: &str) -> HashMap<&str, usize> {
    todo!()
}

/// combine the counts from maps a and b.
fn combine_occurences<'a>(
    a: HashMap<&'a str, usize>,
    b: HashMap<&'a str, usize>,
) -> HashMap<&'a str, usize> {
    todo!()
}
```

---
layout: default

# Combining results

The `combine_documents` function has several useful properties

- our operation is associative `a • (b • c) = (a • b) • c`
- our operation has a neutral value `HashMap::default()`: `0 • x = x • 0 = x`
- therefore we can split the computation `a • b • c • d = (0 • a • b) • (0 • c • d)`
- an associative operation with a neutral value is called a "monoid"

```rust
// for each word, how often it occurs across all documents
documents
    .par_iter()
    .map(|document| count_words(document))
    .reduce(HashMap::default, combine_documents);
```

- this idea means each thread can start accumulating values

# Fearless concurrency
thread-based concurrency in rust


---
layout: default
---

# Fearless concurrency

```rust
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    thread::spawn(f);
    thread::spawn(f);

    println!("Hello from the main thread.");
}

fn f() {
    println!("Hello from another thread!");

    let id = thread::current().id();
    println!("This is my thread id: {id:?}");
}
```

- A process can spawn multiple threads of execution. These run concurrently (and may run in parallel)
- Question: what is the output of this program?

---
layout: default
---

# Expected output

maybe

```
Hello from another thread!
This is my thread id: ThreadId(411)
Hello from another thread!
This is my thread id: ThreadId(412)
Hello from the main thread.
```

or

```
Hello from another thread!
Hello from another thread!
This is my thread id: ThreadId(411)
This is my thread id: ThreadId(412)
Hello from the main thread.
```

---
layout: default
---

# Expected output

but most likely

```
Hello from the main thread.
```

The process exits when the main thread is done!


- `.join()` can be used to block the main thread until the child is done

```rust
fn main() {
    let t1 = thread::spawn(f);
    let t2 = thread::spawn(f);

    println!("Hello from the main thread.");

    t1.join().unwrap();
    t2.join().unwrap();
}
```

- `.join()` turns a panic in the thread into an `Err`

---
layout: default
---

# Thread lifetime

- a more typical example

```rust
let numbers = Vec::from_iter(0..=1000);

let t = thread::spawn(move || {
    let len = numbers.len();
    let sum = numbers.iter().sum::<usize>();
    sum / len
});

let average = t.join().unwrap();

println!("average: {average}");
```

- `numbers` must be `move`d into the closure!

---
layout: default
---

# Thread lifetime

- otherwise `numbers` might be dropped while the thread is still using it!

```rust
let numbers = Vec::from_iter(0..=1000);

let t = thread::spawn(|| {
    let len = numbers.len();
    let sum = numbers.iter().sum::<usize>();
    sum / len
});

drop(numbers); // compile error: would create a dangling reference

let average = t.join().unwrap();

println!("average: {average}");
```

---
layout: default
---

# Thread lifetime: make it known

```rust
let numbers = Vec::from_iter(0..=1000);

let average = thread::scope(|spawner| {
    spawner.spawn(|| {
        let len = numbers.len();
        let sum = numbers.iter().sum::<usize>();
        sum / len
    }).join().unwrap()
});

println!("average: {average:?}");
```

- explicitly bound the lifetime with a scope
- threads are always joined at the end of that scope
- makes immutable references just work

---
layout: default

- but mutable borrowing rules still apply:

```rust
let mut count = 0;
let counter = &mut count;

std::thread::scope(|s| {
    s.spawn(|| { *counter = *counter + 1; });
    s.spawn(|| { *counter = *counter + 1; });
});
```

```txt
error[E0499]: cannot borrow `*counter` as mutable more than once at a time
6 |     thread::scope(|s| {
  |                    - has type `&'1 Scope<'1, '_>`

# Race Conditions

- if multiple mutable borrows were allowed, this could happen ...

- borrowing rules prevent data races & deadlocks
- but also any shared mutable state between threads
- many correct, useful programs are disallowed!
---
layout: default

# Re-defining references

- `&T`: (possibly) shared reference
- `&mut T`: exclusive reference


for safe mutation, we need exclusive *access*, which we can get in multiple ways:

- we have an exclusive reference to the value
- we own the value (we can exclusively borrow from ourselves)
- access is inherently exclusive (atomic operations)


---
layout: default
---

# Atomics

- atomic operations are indivisible, but relatively expensive


```rust
use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicU32, Ordering};

let foo = AtomicU32::new(0);
assert_eq!(foo.fetch_add(10, Ordering::SeqCst), 0);
assert_eq!(foo.load(Ordering::SeqCst), 10);
```

- no risk of a race condition: another thread cannot read the value while an atomic operation is ongoing

```rust
pub fn fetch_add(&self, val: u32, order: Ordering) -> u32
```

---
layout: default
---

# Mutual Exclusion

- `Mutex` allows mutation of a `T` through a shared `&Mutex<T>` reference

```rust
use std::sync::Mutex;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let n = Mutex::new(String::from("foo"));
    thread::scope(|s| {

        s.spawn(|| { n.lock().unwrap().push_str("bar"); });

        s.spawn(|| { n.lock().unwrap().push_str("baz"); });

    });

    println!("{}", n.into_inner().unwrap());
}
```

- threads lock the mutex, but there is no `unlock` ?!

---
layout: default
---

# Sharing ownership between threads

```rust
impl<T> Mutex<T> {
    pub fn lock<'a>(&'a self) -> LockResult<MutexGuard<'a, T>> {
        ...
    }
}
```

- Acquires a mutex, blocking the current thread until it is able to do so
- Returns a `PoisonError` if a thread panicked while holding the lock
- Returns a `MutexGuard`, proof to the type checker that we hold the lock
- `MutexGuard<'a, T>` implements `DerefMut<Target = T>`, so we can use it like a mutable reference

```rust
impl<'a, T> DerefMut for MutexGuard<'a, T> {
    fn deref_mut(&mut self) -> &mut T {
        // ...
    }
}
```

- dropping the `MutexGuard` unlocks the mutex

# Moving ownership between threads

- Some values should never be shared or moved between threads

The `Send` and `Sync` marker traits enforce this:

```rust
pub unsafe auto trait Send { /* no method */ }
pub unsafe auto trait Sync { /* no method */ }
```

- `Send`: A type is Send if it can be sent to another thread. In other words, if ownership of a value of that type can be transferred to another thread
- `Sync`: A type is Sync if it can be shared with another thread. In other words, a type T is Sync if and only if a shared reference to that type `&T` is Send


---
layout: default
---

# `Send`

- A type is Send if it can be sent to another thread. In other words, if ownership of a value of that type can be transferred to another thread


```rust
impl<T: ?Sized> !Send for MutexGuard<'_, T>
impl<T: ?Sized + Sync> Sync for MutexGuard<'_, T>
```

- On certain OS's, only the thread that locked a mutex may unlock it again!

# MPSC: many producer single consumer

```rust
fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = std::sync::mpsc::channel();

    std::thread::scope(|s| {
        for (i, tx) in std::iter::repeat(tx).take(10).enumerate() {
            s.spawn(move || { tx.send(i).unwrap(); });
        }

        s.spawn(move || {
            while let Ok(msg) = rx.recv() {
                println!("{msg}");
            }
        });
    });
}
```

where the `Receiver` is:

```rust
impl<T: Send> Send for Receiver<T>
impl<T> !Sync for Receiver<T>
```
