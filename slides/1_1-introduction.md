# Why learn Rust?

Q: What do you know about Rust?

---
layout: with-footer
---

# What Rust brings

- **Multi-purpose** Build high-quality software, from cloud embedded and systems
- **Core strenghs** "C-like" performance, with memory safety and modern ergonomics
- **Confident developers** SO's most admired (loved) language for 8 years in a row
- **Momentum** Adopted by big tech: Chromium, Linux & Windows kernels

---

# Are there downsides too?

Sure there are. The things mentioned most often:

- **Steep learning curve** Getting *productive* with Rust takes relatively little time, though
- **Relatively new ecosystem** Do your research before getting started
- **Compiling large projects can be slow** Similar to template-heavy C++

# Training format

```rust
let t = thread::spawn(| | loop {
    let question = Question::read_from_crowd();
    question.answer();
})


for part in training.parts() {
    part.slides();
    part.exercises();
}

t.join();

```
