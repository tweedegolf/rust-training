# Memory management

- Most of what we have seen so far is stack-based and small in size
- All these primitive types are `Copy`: create a copy on the stack every time
we need them somewhere else
- We don't want to pass a copy all the time
- Large data that we do not want to copy
- Modifying original data
- What about data structures with a variable size?

# Memory

- A computer program consists of a set of instructions
- Those instructions manipulate some memory
- How does a program know what memory can be used?

<!--
* A program is not just the code that is running, it is also the current state
of that program (the memory).
* But central here is the question: when does a program know when it can use
a specific part of that memory, when is it available?
-->

<!--
* In this simplified view we see the stack mechanism and the heap mechanism
* The stack is a growing stack of used memory, where the only way to remove
memory from being used is by removing it from the top of the stack and the
only way to add is to put it on top of the stack.
* Somehow, as with a lot of CS stuff, we like to turn things around and think
of stacks growing down instead of up in the real world. That is because they are
at the end of the virtual memory address range. So if the stack grows, the stack
pointer (to the current stack frame) is decreased.

# Stack limitations

The stack has limitations though, because it only grows as a result of a
function call.

* Size of items on stack frame must be known at compile time
* If I don't know the size of a variable up front: What size should my stack
frame be?
* How can I handle arbitrary user input efficiently?

<style>
    .footnotes-sep {
        margin-top: 45px;
    }

    .footnotes {
        @apply text-xs opacity-65;
    }

    .footnote-backref {
        display: none;
    }
</style>

<!--
* You can definitely do a lot with just a stack, but really there are some
scenarios that aren't possible, or can only be done very inefficient when
we can only ever push and pop from the top of the stack.
* Because stack frames (at least for low level compiled languages such as Rust,
C and C++) need to be known at compile time, we also have somewhat limited
capabilities for dynamic variable sizes and dynamic user input
* Note that stack based operations are very much a solved problem, and you can
very safely use stack based variables in C and C++, because you don't have to
worry about cleaning them up, there are no pointers.
-->

---

# The Heap

If the lifetime of some data needs to outlive a certain scope, it can not be placed on the stack.
We need another construct: the heap.

It's all in the name, the heap is just one big pile of memory for you to store
stuff in. But what part of the heap is in use? What part is available?

* Data comes in all shapes and sizes
* When a new piece of data comes in we need to find a place in the heap that
still has a large enough chunk of data available
* When is a piece of heap memory no longer needed?
* Where does it start? Where does it end?
* When can we start using it?

<!--
* Meanwhile on the other side of our memory the heap is an unstructured pile
of data just waiting to be used. But how do we know what to use, when to use,
when to stop using? We can't keep on adding more and more memory or we would
run into a runaway memory leak quickly.
* Let's take a look how Rust solves working with the heap for us.
-->

---

# Variable scoping (recap)

```rust
fn main() { // nothing in scope here
    let i = 10; // i is now in scope
    if i > 5 {
        let j = i; // j is now also in scope
        println!("i = {}, j = {}", i, j);
    } // j is no longer in scope, i still remains
    println!("i = {}", i);
} // i is no longer in scope
```

<v-click>

* `i` and `j` are examples containing a `Copy` type
* What if copying is too expensive?

</v-click>

<!--
* When looking at how Rust solves working with the heap, we have to know a little
bit about variable scoping.
* In Rust, every variable has a scope, that is, a section of the code that that
variable is valid for. Note that this isn't that much different to other
programming languages.
* In our example we have `i` and `j`. Note how we can just create a copy by
assigning `i` to `j`.
* Here the type of i and j is actually known as a `Copy` type
* But sometimes there is data that would be way too much to Copy around every
time, it would make our program slow.

# Ownership

- There is always ever only one owner of a stack value
- Once the owner goes out of scope (and is removed from the stack), any associated values on the
  heap will be cleaned up as well
- Rust transfers ownership for non-copy types: *move semantics*

<!--
* What we've just seen is the Rust ownership system in action.
* In Rust, every part of memory in use always has an owner variable. That
variable must always be the only owner, there can't be multiple owners.
* Once a scope that contains a variable ends we don't just pop the top from the
stack, but we also clean up any associated values on the heap.
* We can safely do this because we just said that this variable was the only
owner of that part of memory.
* Assigning a variable to another one actually moves ownership to the other
variable and removes it from the first variable, instead of aliasing it
(which is what C and C++ do)

# Moving out of a function

We can return a value to move it out of the function

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let (len, s1) = calculate_length(s1);
    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);

<!--
* But what if we move a value into a function and we still want to use it
afterwards, we could choose to move it back at the end of the function, but
it really doesn't make for very nice code
* Note that Rust allows us to return multiple values from a function with
this syntax.

# Clone

<img src="/images/A1-clone.jpg" class="float-right w-40" />

- Many types in Rust are `Clone`-able
- Use can use clone to create an explicit clone (in contrast to `Copy` which
  creates an implicit copy).
- Creating a clone can be expensive and could take a long time, so be careful
- Not very efficient if a clone is short-lived like in this example

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = String::from("hellothisisaverylongstring...");
    let len = get_length(x.clone());
    println!("{}: {}", x, len);
}

fn get_length(arg: String) -> usize {
    arg.len()
}
```

<!--
* There is something else in Rust
* Many types implement a way to create an explicit copy, such types are
clone-able. But note how we have to very explicitly say that we want a
clone.
* Such a clone is a full deep copy clone and can of course take a long
time, which is why Rust wants you to be explicit.
* Also in this example this is a really inefficient usage of our clone,
because it gets destroyed almost immediately after creation
-->

# Ownership and borrowing

---

# Ownership
We previously talked about ownership

* In Rust there is always a single owner for each stack value
* Once the owner goes out of scope any associated values should be cleaned up
* Copy types creates copies, all other types are *moved*

<!--
- Note once more that the idea of moving is something that exists in the Rust
  world, but not necesarrily every move actually copies bytes around, these are
  all things where Rust's model is an abstraction over what the compiled code
  actually does.
-->

---

# Moving out of a function
We have previously seen this example


```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let len = calculate_length(s1);
    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
}
fn calculate_length(s: String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

* This does not compile because ownership of `s1` is moved into
 `calculate_length`, meaning it is no longer available in `main` afterwards
* We can use `Clone` to create an explicit copy
* We can give ownership back by returning the value
* What about other options?

---

# Borrowing
- We can make an analogy with real life: if somebody owns something you can
  borrow it from them, but eventually you have to give it back
- If a value is borrowed, it is not moved and the ownership stays with the
  original owner
- To borrow in Rust, we create a *reference*

```rust {all|3|7|all}
fn main() {
    let x = String::from("hello");
    let len = get_length(&x);
    println!("{}: {}", x, len);
}

fn get_length(arg: &String) -> usize {
    arg.len()
}
```

# References (immutable)

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    change(&s);
    println!("{}", s);
}

fn change(some_string: &String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```

- Note how we cannot modify the referenced value through an immutable reference

# References (mutable)

    change(&mut s);
    println!("{}", s);
}

fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```

<v-click>

<div class="no-line-numbers">

```text
hello, world
```

</div>

</v-click>

<v-click>

- A mutable reference can even fully replace the original value
- To do this, you can use the dereference operator (`*`) to modify the value:

```rust
*some_string = String::from("Goodbye");
```

</v-click>

<!--
- We can use a mutable reference here to allow us to modify a borrowed value
- Note that you may also sometimes have to use the deref operator to access
  the value when reading it, but most of the time the Rust compiler will do
  this automatically and you need not worry about it.
-->

---


# Rules for borrowing and references

- You may only ever have **one mutable reference** at the same time
- You may have **any number of immutable references** at the same time **as long as
  there is no mutable reference**
- References cannot *live* longer than their owners
- A reference will always at all times *point to a valid value*

These rules are enforced by Rust's borrow checker.

<!--
- Rust tries to be smart about enforcing these rules, such that you don't notice
  them that often in real life usage, but there may be some cases that clearly
  appear valid, but Rust won't allow. There are generally pretty easy workarounds
  though
- Again: references are not pointers, but in practice of course they do look
  similar and are implemented the same way, but Rust's memory model is not the
  same as that of C/C++ and implementation is not the same as our model.
-->

---

# Borrowing and memory safety
Combined with the ownership model we can be sure that whole classes of errors
cannot occur.

* Rust is memory safe without having to use any runtime background process such
  as a garbage collector
* But we still get the performance of a language that would normally let you
  manage memory manually

<!--
- Memory bugs such as: null pointer dereferences, data races, dangling pointers,
  use after free.
