# Unit 1.1 - Introduction

<a href="/slides/1_1-introduction/" target="_blank">Slides</a>

This is the **open-source Rust training material** we use for our professional multi-day (embedded) Rust training programs.

We have been developing this material in the open **since 2023** and have used it to deliver **over 15 customized in-company training sessions** since then.

The material comprises several modules based on the material of the **[teach-rs](https://trifectatech.org/initiatives/education/) project** (now part of [Trifecta Tech Foundation](https://trifectatech.org)) that we previously co-developed and that we contribute back to when improvements are made.

## Slides and exercises

All of our training programs consists of an **interactive mix of theory and guided exercises**.

The theory is taught by our trainers using the **slides** which are linked at the top of most modules - see the top of this page as well.

We **regularly update** both slides and exercises, integrating the feedback we receive.

## Let us train you!

Studying on your own is good, but being guided through an interactive tailor-made program with your team is more productive, and more fun!
